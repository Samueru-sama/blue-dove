//! Fallback fonts for what egui's own faces cannot draw.
//!
//! egui's bundled faces cover Latin, Greek and Cyrillic, and Latin only in
//! the precomposed letters it ships with: no combining mark, no Vietnamese
//! letter, no note glyph. A library tagged in Japanese or Persian would draw
//! boxes, and so would a title with an accent stored as a letter and a mark.
//! A system font that carries those glyphs is loaded as a fallback, one per
//! script, which costs nothing when none is installed. Letters still come out
//! in the order the tags hold them, and unjoined: egui has no bidirectional
//! layout and no shaping to apply.
//!
//! Which font is installed differs from distribution to distribution and
//! from user to user, so the font directories are searched rather than a
//! list of paths being trusted: a hardcoded list misses the fonts that are
//! actually there, and every title shows as boxes.
